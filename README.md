The frontend of StellarPysio is built using React Native and Expo. It includes various screens and components to provide a seamless user experience. The main directories are:

- `app`: Contains the main screens and navigation structure.
- `components`: Reusable UI components.
- `context`: Context providers for managing global state.
- `handlers`: API handlers for interacting with the backend.
- `utils`: Utility functions and constants.

### Frontend Installation
